Project milestones:

Creating player character and enemy characters, and their behaviors

Creating player’s control (control stick movement and teleportation)

Making the player’s weapons (daggers/throwing knives, smoke bombs/flashbangs)

Creating player’s ability to possess targets / mind control them into attacking other enemies

Creating a stage (making use of corners / multiple routes to hide, different elevations for multiple ways to perform an attack)

Balance the game to be reliably completable within a 5-minute demo time frame
